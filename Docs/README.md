# ForPassJS

## What is ForPassJS?

Software for Creating and Resolving Password Formulas
A formula based password is a form of password one that calculate once they are presented with a login page.

e.g : You want to login into frame.work's website. you know a series of things about this login, the color of the logo, the name, the shape of the logo.
so based on this you consult your formula and you know your password.
so if you password formula, Forpass, says that you get the shape of the logo and type the color 3 times you know that the password is "cogblackblackblack".

But these formulas are too easy. It is ideal if the Forpass can't be guessed even if the result is seen.
This task can be hard, so making a software that can asist you is ideal.

This is why making a tool like this could be very helpful.

## Accesability

The code must be vanilla JS.
Allowing users to download the code and use it without external tools and offline is critical. 
A simple double click on index.html should do the job.

Also so I can understand it.

## Regrets

I stupidly belive that this could be a manageble task, i have not coded in a while in javascript so lets see how it goes.
