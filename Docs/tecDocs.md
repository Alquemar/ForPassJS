# UX

## Simple (what is css? lol)
This is the very basic UI.
```

select variable:    | Dinamic Variables: dval1 dval2 dval3  | Edit
[______________]    | Base Variables: Bval1 Bval2 Bval3     | Edit
        ||
Selected Modifier:  | List of Modifiers:                    | SearchðŸ”Ž
[_______________]   | AddValues, CountLetters, PickLetter, Repeat
        ||
        \/
Result:
[[_________________]]

Formula:            | Copy to clipboard
[__________________________]

Complex:

The following variables will be arrays, position 0 gives the value, position 1 the name of the type of variable.
by this i mean that each variable will be in a box where bellow it will say the value and ontop it will have a small title

Insert base data of the login -> Name, Colour, Activity, logo shape...
    All of the base data that can be achived with only the login screen.

insert anchor password -> Some users have a password they always like to apply, like their first cars numberplate, or their streets address. 
    this info is only used to make it longer.

once the ingredients are layed. We get to cooking.

User selects a variable inserted before.
from here the user will look though the list of funcitons, and find how ever they wan't to modify it.
The result of the modifier is sent to the final line of text at the bottom centre of the page.





    in the future, they will be added into a pool OR the result. the idea is that the same variable can be manipulated in multiple ways.

Once the result is given, the top line adds up the calculation needed if "addPasVar" is used it will be aplied above with the two variables used.

Now that the password has been started they continue adding formulas one and another, ea


We will use the minimum ammount of text in the UI, less things to be translated if we ever make versions in other languages.
Using symbols is more international and intuitive.





It is a password maker, the user will add some variables, two rows, first the dinamic ones and then the base ones.
once a variable is selected down below they will pick a modifier.
once the modifier is selected the result is displayed below, the user can do this again until they receive the password they desire.
