# ForPass Creator Project

## The first prototype:

There are two ways i can aproach this, I think the most reasonable one, to move (at all) and break a bunch would be:
bunch of functions -> "Formulators.ts" give me some variables and return the result.
make a way to store variables -> base home stuff
make a way to get the stored variables and put them inside the funciton.
give a result.
check quality of result, even pass it though the how many years it would take to break.



1. add variables
2. select the variables
3. one basic modifiyer (like multipliying variable)
4. deliver result

For example, geting a variable called "color" and then when mutiply formulator is picked it will just multiply the "color" string.

the first version will not be drag and drop
will literally be buttons one clicks and it adds the options
i also don't expect to have a clipboard to code resolution system


# random:

line of text that creates the formula. 
formula restrictions, "must have lower and upper case, must have numbers, must have symbols..." they should be able to put them on and off with a check box.
