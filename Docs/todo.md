# Think about the entire project and draw its functionality.

The first prototype:

I expect it to be able to intake variables
Be able to transform slightly these variables
And deliver them to a resulting box.

For example, geting a variable called "color" and then when mutiply formulator is picked it will just multiply the "color" string.
blueblueblueblue.




the first version will not be drag and drop

will literally be buttons one clicks and it adds the options


i also don't expect to have a clipboard to code resolution system
